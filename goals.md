# Goals for the mtg-link project

* Allow users to store deck lists easily.
* Allow users to revise decks without losing past states of the deck.
  * Decks may be committed to the history as a special state (milestone) for easy
    traversal, with all in-between states still being logged.
* Allow users to manage their inventories easily
  * Generate an inventory from deck lists.
* Decks are degenerate to a text file in a git repository.
* Allow users to explore decks in mtg-link by cards contained, combos used, special tags,
  and central cards.
