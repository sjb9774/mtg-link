## What is it?

mtg-link is a project that attempts to bring a simple and minimal revision-control system
to the world of Magic: The Gathering.

A common problem when creating decks for Magic is keeping track of the different variations
and permutations that can occur from a single base deck-idea. mtg-link intends to help
manage these ideas by allowing a user to start a new Deck Project consisting simply of a
list of cards. Generally, this will be a rough-draft decklist. Generally this would be a
deck that could be described in a single, short sentence. For example "Blue/White flyers"
may be the Project's origin, with some basic, prototypically list of cards that comprise
a deck based around flying creatures in the colors of Blue and White.

mtg-link comes in handy when the creator decides that they believe the deck has some
promise, but needs work. Perhaps it's decided that the deck either needs to be more
aggressive or more controlling. The creator can then create two forks of the original deck
and then add or remove cards as necessary from these forks, all while keeping a clear
history of what the deck once had, in case it's decided the deck has taken a turn for the
worst and needs to be backtracked.

This process of forking, modifying, and rewinding as needed defines a clear, iterative
process for creating new decks. Coupled with mtg-link's ability to calculate relevant
data and construct easy-to-read visualizations for it, mtg-link is a powerful tool for
recognizing trends in your top-performing decks so you may follow them and employ them in
future projects.

## Features

#### Deck lists!
At its core, mtg-link is a place for you to keep track of the decks you have and are
working on, so feel free to add as many decks as you like. We'll take care of number-
crunching for you and provide you with automatic feedback on what formats your deck is
legal in, what kind of composition your deck has (creatures:land:instant:sorcery:etc), and
what other decks on mtg-link you might look at for inspiration!

#### Natural Categorization
You can tag your decks with the labels that make sense to you and your fellow players.
Decks can be automatically cateogorized by color and composition, but do you consider your
deck aggressive? Controlling? Innovative? Novel? A good starter deck?

Additionally decks can be linked with "Key Cards". These are the cards your deck centers
around if it does, for you combo players it's going to be the card(s) you exploit for
maximum gain.
